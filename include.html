This app is inspired by <a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/about/">Emily Riederer&#39;s</a> blog post
<a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/sql-generation/">blog post about translating dplyr commands to SQL</a>. 
I found this blog post very nice and useful, so I wanted to build this app to play around with the concepts discussed in the blog post. I did not include the linter, sqlfluff, because I'm lazy.
